Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Recognizing the importance of timely and accurate diagnosis, I embarked on a project to develop a system that predicts CVD with high precision and reliability.
To achieve this, I conducted intensive research and employed various machine learning algorithms to forecast heart disease using diverse datasets. The project involved analyzing a dataset from Kaggle, which included attributes related to heart disease such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
I utilized six classification algorithms to predict cardiovascular disease:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Decision Tree

For this project, I trained the models using a publicly available dataset of cardiovascular disease cases. The primary goal was to develop an efficient and accurate system for diagnosing heart disease. To enhance the model's performance, I implemented several feature selection algorithms, including Relief, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance (mRMR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Local Learning, to remove irrelevant and redundant features.

This project demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and develop solutions that can potentially save lives by enabling early detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
