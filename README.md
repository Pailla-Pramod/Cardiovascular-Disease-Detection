Cardiovascular Disease or coronary illness is one of the significant dangerous infections in the 
entire world. It is also the major cause for significant number of deaths. So, proper and timely diagnosis 
treatment of such diseases is necessary. It Requires a system that can predict with precise accuracy and 
reliability. Intensive research is carried out by our team members using diverse machine learning 
algorithms to forecast the heart disease taking different datasets which consists of different attributes that 
result in heart attack. We analyzed the dataset collected from Kaggle which consists of attributes related 
to heart disease such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol and so on. 
 We employ six classification algorithms to predict cardiovascular disease. Models are trained 
using a publicly available dataset of cardiovascular disease cases. we proposed an efficient and accurate 
system to diagnosis heart disease and the system is based on machine learning techniques. The system is 
developed based on classification algorithms includes Support vector machine, Logistic regression, K
nearest neighbor, Na√Øve bays, Random Forest, and Decision tree while standard features selection 
algorithms have been used such as Relief, Minimal redundancy maximal relevance, least absolute 
shrinkage selection operator and Local learning for removing irrelevant and redundant features.
